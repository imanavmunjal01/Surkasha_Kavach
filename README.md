Team Suraksha_Kavach presents the Anti Ambush Retaliation Vehicle (AARV)—a groundbreaking defense system designed to protect soldiers, security forces, and civilians from deadly ambush attacks. With increasing threats to convoys and military personnel, AARV offers an innovative solution by providing instant protection and a chance to fight back, saving lives in critical situations. Our system features a multi-layered bulletproof shield made of Dynamee,Ceramic Composite,Kevlar and Aluminium, capable of stopping bullets, reducing impact, and absorbing shock. Its automatic hydraulic system deploys the shield in just seconds, allowing for immediate cover during an ambush. Unlike traditional armored vehicles that are costly and limited to select personnel, AARV is an attachment that can be easily installed on existing vehicles like Scorpios, buses, and police vans, making it a cost-effective and scalable security solution. As part of the Make in India initiative, AARV provides affordable, efficient, and reliable protection, empowering both security forces and civilians to stay safe in high-risk areas. Whether safeguarding troop movements or protecting everyday commuters in conflict zones, AARV is a lifeline that enhances security without the need for expensive armored fleets. Join us in making a difference—innovate, protect, and save lives. Jai Hind!
